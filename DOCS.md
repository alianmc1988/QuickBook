# Reservation System

The reservation system (like for a hotel or restaurant) is an application that allows users to make reservations, check availability, and manage their bookings. Below is a general approach on how to design the architecture and key considerations of a reservation system, with **PostgreSQL**, **TypeORM**, and **NestJS**.

## 1. System Requirements

### Functional:

- **Reservation Management**: Users can make reservations for a restaurant, hotel, or any service with limited availability.
- **Availability Check**: Users can view available dates/times to make a reservation.
- **Reservation Confirmation**: Users receive an email or notification confirming their reservation.
- **User Management**: Users can register, log in, and manage their reservations.
- **Cancellation and Modification**: Users can cancel or modify their reservations within certain restrictions.
- **Reservation History**: Users can view their past reservations.

### Non-Functional:

- **Scalability**: The system must be able to handle a large number of simultaneous reservations without affecting performance.
- **High Availability**: The system must be fault-tolerant and allow space reservations 24/7.
- **Security**: User data must be secure, especially when processing payments or managing sensitive information.

## 2. Main Components

### 1. Frontend (Client)

- Web or mobile application where users interact with the system to check availability, make reservations, and manage them.
- It can be a **Single Page Application (SPA)** using **React**, **Vue.js**, or **Angular**, making requests to the backend API.

### 2. Backend (NestJS + TypeORM)

- **NestJS** is used for building the backend API, offering a modular and scalable architecture.
- **TypeORM** will be used to interact with the **PostgreSQL** database, which stores data such as users, reservations, and spaces.

- **Main Endpoints**:
  - `POST /reservations`: To make a new reservation.
  - `GET /reservations/{user_id}`: To get the reservations of a user.
  - `GET /availability/{date}`: To check the availability on a given date.
  - `DELETE /reservations/{reservation_id}`: To cancel a reservation.
  - `PUT /reservations/{reservation_id}`: To modify a reservation.

### 3. Database (PostgreSQL + TypeORM)

- **PostgreSQL** is used as the relational database to store data.
- **TypeORM** is a powerful ORM to map JavaScript/TypeScript objects to database tables.

- **Database Structure**:
  - **Users**: Table to store user information.
  - **Reservations**: Table containing information about reservations, such as `user_id`, `date`, `time`, `reserved space`, etc.
  - **Spaces**: If the system is for a hotel, these can be rooms; for a restaurant, these can be tables. Each space has availability at certain times.
  - **History**: Optionally, a table to keep track of past reservations.

### 4. Message Queue / Eventual Processing

- Use message queues like **RabbitMQ** or **Amazon SQS** to handle asynchronous tasks like sending emails or notifications after making a reservation.
- Process high-demand tasks without blocking the main flow.

### 5. External Services

- **Email Services**: To send confirmations and notifications to users. Example: **SendGrid**, **Amazon SES**.
- **Payment System (if applicable)**: If the system allows payment for reservations, integration with **Stripe**, **PayPal**, or any payment system is needed.

## 3. Architecture

Here is a high-level architecture diagram:
